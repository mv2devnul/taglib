A pure Lisp implementation for reading MPEG-4 audio and MPEG-3 audio tags and audio information.

** Mostly complete.  Your mileage may vary. Most definitely, NOT portable.  Heavily dependent on Clozure CCL.

Note: There a lot of good (some great) audio file resources out there.  Here are a few of them:
* [-smash][http://code.google.com/p/l-smash/]
* [taglib][http://taglib.github.io/]
* [mplayer][http://www.mplayerhq.hu]
* [The MP4 Book][http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?index=books&linkCode=qs&keywords=0130616214]
